Scripts to monitor BIGIP memory status using bigstart.

CXXXXXX = customer case number
<HOSTNAME> = BIGIP hostname
<Mon-day-HourMinute> = time stamp of when the  script is started


2#tar xvf CXXXXXX-scripts.tar;  cd CXXXXXX-scripts
3#./install

After step 3, the scripts will automatically start up and start monitoring system memory stats, the log file is generated under /var/tmp, the file name looks like <HOSTNAME>-<Mon-Day-HourMinute>-stats_log.X

You could also see the log file end with X, Y or Z which is that the log file get rotated every 8 hour so one single log file does not get too large. 

4, You can stop the script anytime by:
#bigstart stop memstats

5, start it again:

#bigstart start memstats

memstats will automatically start when BIGIP reboot

6,To delete the script, you can simply run the remove script in CXXXXXX-scripts directory
#./remove
